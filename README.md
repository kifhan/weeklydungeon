# Run and deploy your AI Studio app

This contains everything you need to run your app locally.

## Run Locally

Prerequisites: Node.js, Firebase project (Firestore enabled)

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and set:
   - VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY
   - VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
   - VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
   - VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
   - VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
   - VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID
   - Optional: GEMINI_API_KEY (for AI features)
3. Ensure Firestore rules from `firestore.rules` are deployed (or use the emulator)
4. Run the app: `npm run dev`

### Data model and sync

- Auth via Google; per-user data lives under `users/{uid}` in Firestore.
- Habit entries: `users/{uid}/habits/{entryId}`.
- Weekly schedule: `users/{uid}/weeks/{weekKey}` as a single doc mirroring `WeekData`.
- Logs: `users/{uid}/logs/{logId}`.
- UI uses optimistic updates; Firestore is the source of truth. LocalStorage caches data for offline.

### Security rules

Rules enforce per-user access under `users/{uid}` and cover habits, weeks, logs, and optional Kanban boards.

### Authentication

- Enable Google and Anonymous sign-in providers in Firebase Console → Authentication → Sign-in method.
- The landing page offers both "Sign in with Google" and "Continue as Guest" (anonymous).
